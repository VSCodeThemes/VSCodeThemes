## How it Works

VS Code Themes scans the Visual Studio Marketplace and maintains a searchable database of themes.

In order for a theme to show up on the website:

1. A description must exist in the [extension's manifest](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/extension-manifest)
2. Themes must be `.json` (`.tmTheme` files are not supported)

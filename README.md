## How do I get my theme on VSCodeThemes?

In order for your themes to show up on
[vscodethemes](https://vscodethemes.com) they must:

- Be published to the
  [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads)
- Have
  [themes in the contributes field](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributesthemes)
  of your extension's package.json
- See [theme variables](theme-variables/index.ts) for which GUI and token
  colors are used

If you're not sure why a theme isn't showing up, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/jschr/vscodethemes/issues/new).

Consult the
[VSCode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers)
for how to build your own theme.
